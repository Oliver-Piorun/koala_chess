**Attention:** This game is currently not in development :construction:

Maybe it will turn into a "Rust 2D Rendering Proof-of-Concept (PoC)", as my interests have shifted a bit in the last months and the implemented technical part was the most exciting. We will see!

Anyway, feel free to build it from source until release versions are published! :blush:

## :desktop_computer: Supported platforms
